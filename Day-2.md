# Day 2 - Learning DSA

## Topics Covered:
- **Static Array**
- **Dynamic Array**
- **String**

### 📝 Summary:
Today, I deepened my understanding of arrays and strings. Here's a brief overview:

#### 📌 Static Array:
- Fixed-size array allocated at compile time.
- Efficient in terms of memory but lacks flexibility.

#### 📌 Dynamic Array:
- Allows resizing based on needs.
- Often implemented using data structures like `ArrayList` in Java or `Vector` in C++.
- Uses additional memory for dynamic resizing operations.

#### 📌 String:
- Sequence of characters stored in contiguous memory.
- Mutable (`StringBuilder`) vs. Immutable (`String` in Java).
- Common operations include concatenation, substring extraction, and character manipulation.
