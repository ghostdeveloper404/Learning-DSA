# Day 2 - Learning DSA

## Topics Covered:
- **Static Array**
- **Dynamic Array**
- **String**

### 📝 Summary:
Today, I deepened my understanding of arrays and strings in Python. Here's a brief overview:

#### 📌 Static Array:
- Python doesn’t have built-in static arrays like C++, but lists can be used similarly with a fixed size.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Fixed-size list (conceptually a static array)
  print(arr[2])  # Output: 3
  ```

#### 📌 Dynamic Array:
- Python lists are dynamic by default—they can grow and shrink.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  arr = []  # Empty list
  arr.append(10)
  arr.append(20)
  arr.append(30)
  print(arr)  # Output: [10, 20, 30]
  ```

#### 📌 String:
- Strings are immutable in Python, meaning modifications create a new string.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  s = "Hello"
  new_s = s + " World"  # Concatenation
  print(new_s)  # Output: "Hello World"
  ```
